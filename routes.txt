    }
    // so what is going to happen is if i type "localhost:3001/profile" in the 
    //into the web browser, I will see the 'This is the profile page" written on the html page.

    //Now i can have multiple url pages to display that and how I can orient it
    //is by having multiple if or else if statments to dictate which one goes where
    // so if i wanted the "cheeseburgers" on my default i would just do this:
    else if(url == "/"){

        //"localhost:3001/settings" page that will be delivered(method = POST) to the settings page (action='/settings')
        //i will still be on the settings page because I havent set it to go some place else.

    //correctly submitted and went through properly
    //the "localhost:3001" page would show 'Form was submitted'. Now if I hit the refresh button on my browser i,e ‚ü≥
    //then i get the "confirm form resubmission - Continue or Cancel" ..hitting continue will resubmit that same data again
    //So if i am trying to get back to the settings page i have to click on the brower url, which would have "localhost:3001/settings" and hit enter key
    //this sends me back to the settings page where i can write some more stuff

module.exports = displayContent;//notcie how this doesnt have 
//any parenthesis so we arent calling the function. we are only saying the name of the function
// how this will work is that on the "iMob.js" file i will put a
//displayContent = require('./routes') to as for what the module is exporting from my main page.
